# codebugs pre-commit hook — installed as .git/hooks/pre-commit by
# tools/install-hooks.sh (symlink, so edits here take effect immediately).
#
# This is the git-level half of "main is never edited directly". It is a git
# hook rather than a Claude Code hook on purpose: it binds the user, every
# agent, and every subprocess identically, and it cannot be forgotten by a
# session that never read CLAUDE.md.
#
# It enforces exactly two things, both already written in CLAUDE.md:
#
#   1. On main, the ONLY thing that may be committed is a .claude/plans/*.md
#      note. Everything else belongs on a branch, in a worktree.
#   2. On any other branch, the branch must carry a sanctioned type.
#
# It does NOT run tests or lint. tools/worktree-finish.sh is the quality gate
# and runs them in the worktree against the post-forward-merge tree; duplicating
# them here would add seconds to every commit to re-check a state that is not
# the one being landed.
#
# The integration merge in worktree-finish.sh passes --no-verify, and git does
# not run pre-commit for a merge in any case (it runs pre-merge-commit).
#
# Escape hatch: `git commit --no-verify`. Deliberately left open — this hook
# exists to stop the accidental case, and an operator typing --no-verify has
# stated an intent. The record of that intent is the flag itself.
